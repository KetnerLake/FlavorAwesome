    <!-- FAQ -->
    <lake-section id="faq" title="Frequently Asked Questions">
      <lake-question title="How does recording flavors help me develop my palate?">
        By writing down what you taste, you build awareness of flavor details you might otherwise overlook. This practice sharpens your palate and helps you to revisit flavors you enjoy.
      </lake-question>
      <lake-question title="How is this different from a food diary app?">
        Unlike a calorie tracker or food log, Flavor Awesome is about taste - not nutrition or dieting. It is designed to help you explore and enjoy the sensory side of eating.
      </lake-question>
      <lake-question title="How do AI-powered suggestions work?">
        AI is used to analyze your flavor notes to spot patterns in your preferences. It then suggests new foods, pairings, or experiences you’re likely to enjoy based on your unique palate.
      </lake-question>            
      <lake-question title="Do I need to be a foodie or wine expert to use this?">
        Not at all  - but it could make you into one! Flavor Awesome is for anyone who enjoys food and wants to be more mindful about taste, whether casual or expert.
      </lake-question>                 
      <lake-question title="Can I use this for specific diets (vegan, keto, etc.)?">
        Yes. Flavor Awesome is not a dietary or weight loss plan. It is focused on flavor and personal taste development. What or how you choose to eat is up to you.
      </lake-question>                                    
      <lake-question title="Is my data private and secure?">
        Absolutely. Your flavor notes are yours alone - I do not sell your data, and you stay in control of your personal flavor journey.
      </lake-question>
